## Summary/Abstract:
The rapid development of technology is currently giving birth to innovations that can be solutions to the problems faced by humans. With good use of technology, a system will make it easier for humans to complete a job. Various layers of society have taken advantage of current technological developments to streamline their work processes, starting from the agricultural sector, fisheries, and so on. One example that we often encounter is the existence of various quite sophisticated devices scattered in several parts of the world.
Fruits are one of the most important agricultural commodity groups in the world. Due to the high production rate and wide distribution of the fruit, we must be able to classify the degree of ripeness according to the content of the fruit. The process of sorting fruit for cultivation is still using manual methods such as evaluation by fruit farmers. One of the downsides to this method is that things happen differently because of people's perceived limitations. Based on these challenges, we conducted research to classify fruit ripeness to determine whether the fruit is suitable. We use machine learning to be able to determine several things that must be considered in determining the level of maturity and content of a fruit.
